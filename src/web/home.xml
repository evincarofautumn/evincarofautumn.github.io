    <para>
     A rare being from the forests of New England,
     transplanted to California.
    </para>

    <para>
     Most of my work is in programming language technology,
     including
     type systems,
     modern compiler design,
     parsing,
     code generation,
     usability design,
     and garbage collector implementation.
     I am familiar with an unusually broad array
     of programming technologies,
     but I have the most familiarity and professional experience
     with Haskell, C, C++, and Perl.
    </para>

    <para>
     I am available for hire to write code
     or to manage, teach, and mentor those who do,
     preferably using Haskell, Rust, or similar.
     The code I write is unusually reliable,
     but I do not produce it quickly.
